Instructions for getting web-cdi to work locally as of 3/16/18

Clone the repo

Ask for these files from current lab manager (not on Github) These files go in the webcdi/webcdi folder:
- databases.py
- secret_key.py
- email.py
- captcha.py

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install postgresql. The databases.py file will have the name of the user and database (locally and on prod / dev servers)

It may be difficult to rerun all migrations and get the schema working, so an alternative is to copy data from current dev database and import into your local db. 
pg_dump -h [dev db hostname from databases.py] -p 5432 -U [db user] [db name] > file.sql 

psql -h localhost -d [db name] -U [db user] -f file.sql

Once you have the data, and installed packages, you should be able to run the server:

./manage.py runserver --insecure

Working with postgres could be difficult. There are instructions online, as well as some legacy instructions in setup_OUTDATED.txt that may help.
